-->What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git begins to keep track of the repository and it's contents. On the next commit, you can start tracking changes.

-->How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?What value do you think it offers?

I am yet to grab the difference
++I fully understand. The staging area offers you some kind of operation table -  a work bench to add selected parts of your work and edit them, before commiting.

-->How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You add only the files that have changes that are logically linked, and commit those files.
